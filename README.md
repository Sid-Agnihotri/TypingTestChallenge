Project details - 

This Typing test Challenge is created with NextJS and here are the app features - 

- User will be provided with a random text paragraph or the user can c/p his own choice of the paragraph.
- User can select the time duration of the test it can be 1 m, 2m 5m, or custom.
- For each correct word, he will get 1 point for each incorrect word he types he will receive 0 points.
- At the end of the test, the user will be presented with his score which is his typing accuracy and speed.


You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
